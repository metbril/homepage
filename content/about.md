*Please read what I'm [doing now][now]!.*

Hi. My name is Robert van Bregt. I am born and raised in [Rotterdam][rotterdam].
From a young age, I have been fascinated by the opportunities and possibilities that computers can offer us to make our lives easier, better, more beautiful and more fun.

## Private life

Always curious about [the latest technological developments][tweakers].
[Online privacy and freedom][bitsoffreedom] advocate.
[Home automator](/tags/domotics).
[Code tinkerer](/tags/code).
Spectacles wearer.
Secretly a bit nerdy?
Ad-hoc geocacher.

## Professional life

After a study Business Economics & Information Technology at a university of applied sciences, a few years of working in system administration and software development I entered into project management.
At first in the financial services industry, and after that in healthcare.
Nowadays I manage all kinds of difficult, complex projects with ease. But the focus of the work and my heart remains with my "old love" Information Technology.

More information is available in my [CV]({{< ref "/cv" >}} ) (in Dutch) or in [my LinkedIn profile][linkedin].

## Supported charities

I am particularly fond of the work of [Bits of Freedom][bitsoffreedom]. They fight for our digital freedom. In addition to providing information and education, they mainly try to share their vision with policy makers.
