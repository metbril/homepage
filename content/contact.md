:wave: Hi. Nice to see you.

## E-mail

The most convenient way to get in touch is to [send an e-mail](mailto:contact.rjib@vanbregt.eu?subject=Hey).
I usually respond to messages within 24 hours, but please be patient if it takes a little longer. :wink:

Confidential messages, like private pictures or documents with personal data, should be sent **encrypted** to my e-mail address **robertvanbregt** [at] [ProtonMail.com](https://protonmail.com/).
The easiest way to do this is, to [create an account with ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/signup) yourself and send from there.
When in doubt or trouble, please send a request for help by regular e-mail first.
If you already use PGP, then use [my Protonmail public key](/key.asc) with a suitable e-mail address.

## Messaging

However, I prefer short text messages, via [Signal](https://signal.org/nl/) in particular. Signal is a [privacy friendly alternative to WhatsApp](https://www.fixjeprivacy.nl/tip/ruil-whatsapp-in-voor-een-privacyvriendelijk-alternatief/).
I also use Apple iMessage and plain old SMS.

## Elsewhere

You can also find me elsewhere on the Internet, for example:
