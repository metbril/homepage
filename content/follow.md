There are several ways to follow what I publish to this website if you do not want to skim the pages every now and then.

The easiest is to follow one or more RSS feeds with a feed reader of your choice. I can recommend Feedly if you are new to RSS.

My site provides multiple feeds that you might want to read. Just browse to the page you like and append `index.xml` to the url.

To follow:

- the homepage: [/index.xml](/index.xml)
- a category, for example "Outdoor": [/categories/outdoor/index.xml](/categories/outdoor/index.xml)
- a specific tag, for example "RSS": [/tags/rss/index.xml](/tags/rss/index.xml)
