## Privacy

I do not track you. No personal information is stored.

This site is hosted by Codeberg Pages. Their privacy policy can be found [here][codeberg-privacy].

## Disclaimer

Everything I write and publish over here is my own material and in my personal capacity. You will never read my employer's opinions or policies here. If I do use someone else's material, I will always try to get permission in advance and mention the source. If you come across material without a (correct) mention, please [let me know][contact]. I will then change the listing or remove the material immediately.

## Affiliations

Very occasionally I will also post links to products and services for which I receive something in return, without any additional cost for you. For example, a very small amount of money if you buy something from Bol.com via this site, or extra storage space or extension of a subscription if I introduce new users to a service. Sometimes you even get some extras yourself. That way you can [support][support] me a little with keeping this site up and financing my hobbies.
