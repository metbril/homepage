## Privacy

I do not track you. No personal information is stored. This site does not make use of cookies.

This site is hosted by [Codeberg Pages][codeberg-pages]. Their privacy policy can be found [here][codeberg-privacy].

## Disclaimer

Everything I write and publish over here is my own material and in my personal capacity. You will never read my employer's opinions or policies here.

If I do use someone else's material, I will always try to get permission in advance and mention the source. If you come across material without a (correct) mention, please [let me know][contact]. I will then change the listing or remove the material immediately.

## Affiliations

Very occasionally I will include links to products and services for which I receive something in return, without any additional cost for you. For example, a very small amount of money if you buy something from Bol.com via this site, or extra storage space or extension of a subscription if I introduce new users to a service. Sometimes you even get some extras yourself. That way you can [support][support] me a little with keeping this site up and financing my hobbies.

## No AI/ML use clause

You are prohibited from using any data or content from this website for training of or developing any artificial intelligence or machine learning model without obtaining explicit consent from the copyright owner. Any unauthorized use of data or content for AI/ML purposes will be considered a violation of copyright laws and may result in legal action.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any content on this site being text, images, video or any other format, is licenced under [the CC BY-SA 4.0 license][cc-by-sa-40]. This means that you can share it as long as you attribute me as the original author and link back to this website (https://vanbregt.eu).

Code examples are available with [the MIT license][mit]. This more or less means you can do whatever you like with the code, as long as you respect the copyright.
