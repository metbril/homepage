## Enabling nurses to work mobile digitally

I manage the implementation of smart medical alarm management in combination with the introduction of a medical graded smartphone for [our](https://maasstadziekenhuis.nl) nurses that will also be used to work mobile with the electronic patient file.

## Enhancing skills to facilitate group discussions

One day, I hope to become proficient in [Liberating Structures](https://liberatingstructures.com), which I stumbled upon by chance while looking for more information about Scrum.

## Living outdoors

I can't wait for spring, to start traveling again with the camper we bought last August.
When looking for a purpose to go walking or cycling outdoors, I usually go [geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com).

## Automating home and life

My wife and son sometimes get desparate when the lights fail to work after I have been tinkering with them. However, I still continue to enjoy smartening our home a lot. And automating the boring personal stuff. It's really satisfying to see new technology coming to life.
